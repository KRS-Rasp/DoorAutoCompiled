# Should be the Correct One

## How to Run:

Note: if you windows, you will first need to build `dlib` using wheel.

1. create a virtual environment 
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. install requirements
    ```bash
    pip install -r reqs.txt
    ```
    This 100% works on windows, but might need calibration in linux.

3. run the app
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
